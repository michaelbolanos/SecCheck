## General info
SecCheck is a Python program to display a user's workstation statistics in a GUI.

v.1.0-v.2.2

There may be some security checks implemented in this program.

Inherently, Windows 10 already detects the .EXE as malware so there is a security checker as a byproduct.

- Detected as malware in Windows 10 Defender (false positive)

## About the author


Author:   Michael Bolanos

Michael Bolanos is a freelance IT & Security Consultant

The purpose of this project is to gather some code and make progress in learning Python programming.

## Background

Many people learn best doing things hands on.  My meager programming skills have gotten me to this point.  I have always wanted to write cross platform apps, so this is my meager attempt while I study more Python it gives me a way to practice deploying my code to Github and collaborate with others.

Mastering Python has eluded me due to (blah, blah blah,) no excuses, just practice now.  So I'm working on this:

I am going through the materials and quizzes and making progress.  I try and practice code at least 2-4 hours everyday now, that also involves watching YouTube, reading up on individual topics, trying stuff in my IDE (PyCharm), and Idle sometimes.
