## General info
SecCheck is a Python program to display a user's workstation statistics in a GUI.

v.1.0-v.2.2

There may be some security checks implemented in this program.

Inherently, Windows 10 already detects the .EXE as malware so there is an implied security checker as a byproduct..

- Detected as malware in Windows 10 Defender (false positive)
- You must tell Windows to just run the program if Bitdefender is on keep an eye out for notifications
- This is only a security aid and does not offer protection


- Project Created:  12/11/20


## Technologies
This program was written to practice Python with some practical application in mind.

Normally you will run these apps from the Downloads folder

## About the author


Author:   Michael Bolanos

Michael Bolanos is a freelance IT & Security Consultant

The purpose of this project is to gather some code and make progress in learning Python programming.

## Background

Many people learn best doing things hands on.  My meager programming skills have gotten me to this point.  I have always wanted to write cross platform apps for security. So, this is my meager attempt.  It gives me a way to practice Python, deploying my code, and pushing it to Github to collaborate with others.

I found some motivation here:  [Google IT Automation with Python](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation)

I am going through the materials and quizzes and making progress.  I practice code at least 2-4 hours everyday, that also involves watching YouTube (sometimes), reading up on individual topics, trying stuff in my IDE (PyCharm), and Idle sometimes.  

I made a simple GUI (with PySimpleGUI, and Tkinter), and with Pyinstaller I created an EXE for Windows and an app for Mac (need to output for Linux.)

## To do or not to do

- Add some buttons with additional modules
- More security checking
- Bitdefender complaining, Unknown Publisher (this could be useful)
- Better colors, people like a pretty GUI
- Run Windows Bitdefender scan e.g. MpCmdRun.exe -Scan -ScanType 2 - note caused max cpu utilization 12-21-20
Maybe enable CPU throttling https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-antivirus/command-line-arguments-microsoft-defender-antivirus
- Currently using Github Pages to distribute binary images, consider using releases instead or only.
