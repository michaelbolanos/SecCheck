## General info
SecCheck is a Python program to display a user's workstation statistics in a GUI.

v.1.0-v.2.2

There may be some security checks implemented in this program.

Inherently, Windows 10 already detects the .EXE as malware so there is a security checker as a byproduct.

- Detected as malware in Windows 10 Defender (false positive)

## About the author


Author:   Michael Bolanos

Michael Bolanos is a freelance IT & Security Consultant

The purpose of this project is to gather some code and make progress in learning Python programming.

## Why

Many people learn best doing things hands on.  My meager programming skills have gotten me to this point.  I have always wanted to write cross platform apps, so this is my meager attempt while I study more Python it gives me a way to practice deploying my code to Github and collaborate with others.
