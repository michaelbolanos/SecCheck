## General info
SecCheck is a Python program to display a user's workstation statistics in a GUI.

v.1.0-v.2.2

There may be some security checks implemented in this program.

Inherently, Windows 10 already detects the .EXE as malware so there is an implied security checker as a byproduct.

- Detected as malware in Windows 10 Defender (false positive)
- You must tell Windows to just run the program if Bitdefender is on keep an eye out for notifications
- This app is only a security aid and does not offer protection


- Project Created:  12/11/20


## Technologies
This program was written to practice Python with some practical application in mind.

## Just run the apps
If you just want to run the Apps the programs by themselves are in the Apps directory

Apps (Releases)

Normally you will run these apps from the Downloads folder

## About the author


Author:   Michael Bolanos

Michael Bolanos is a freelance IT & Security Consultant

The purpose of this project is to gather some code and make progress in learning Python programming.

## Background

Many people learn best doing things hands on.  My meager programming skills have gotten me to this point.  I have always wanted to write cross platform apps for security. So, this is a meager first attempt.  It gives me a way to practice Python, deploying my code, and pushing it to Github to collaborate with others.

I found some motivation here:  [Google IT Automation with Python](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation)

I made a simple GUI (with PySimpleGUI, and Tkinter), and with Pyinstaller I created an EXE for Windows and an app for Mac (need to output for Linux.)

## To do or not to do

- Add some buttons with additional modules
- Better colors, people like a pretty GUI
- Currently using Github Pages to distribute binary images, consider using releases instead or only.

## To do security
- Bitdefender complaining, Unknown Publisher (this could be useful)

- To successfully install a Windows 10 application, the package doesn't just have to be signed but also trusted on the device.  It is essential to sign our app to effectively have it installed in a Windows environment.

- Add security levels for checks
